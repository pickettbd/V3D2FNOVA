# V3D2FNOVA
Prepare Visual 3D (V3D) data for FNOVA at UNC-CH

## Purpose
This project is intended as a data transformation step. Normalized V3D files (tab-separated value) are previously generated for each subject and each condition. These are then transformed using this simple tool. The output is somewhat strangly-formatted, but it is the format needed for an FNOVA analysis. This process is employed by researchers at UNC-CH as part of a vGRF (vertical Ground Reaction Force) manipulation project. It could, however, be used or modified for other purposes.
